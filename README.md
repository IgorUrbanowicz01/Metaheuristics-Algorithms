# Metahuristics Algorithms

This repository contains three algorithms that use metaheuristic algorithms to try and solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

## Algorithms

### Easy Implementations

The first set of algorithms are easy to implement and include:

- K-random
- Greedy
- Two-opt

### Tabu Search

The second algorithm is a Tabu Search that uses a Tabu list to prevent revisiting previously visited solutions.

### Genetic Algorithm

The third algorithm is a Genetic Algorithm that uses a population of candidate solutions and applies genetic operators like mutation and crossover to generate new candidate solutions.

## Usage

Each algorithm is contained in its own folder and can be run by executing the main file. The required input data for the TSP problem should be placed in the same folder.
